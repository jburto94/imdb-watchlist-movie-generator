### How it was built
Using vanilla JS with a few lines of CSS

### How it works

When the user's IMDB watchlist page loads, a link in the right sidebar will appear. When clicked the link will display a single item on the user's watchlist.
For some longer lists, the extension will autoload them. If the connection is slow or the user's list is extrememly long, they may need to scroll through the list and as the images and text are lazy loaded.


### Why I built it
This is for people who have a list of movies or tv shows that they plan on watching, but are too indecisive on what to choose.
